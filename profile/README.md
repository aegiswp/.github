## About the Aegis Theme

Aegis is a block theme built with the future of WordPress in mind. It leverages WordPressâ€™s [**Full Site Editing**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/) features to give users granular control over their website's appearance without writing a single line of code. With predefined styles and flexibility to create custom layouts, Aegis is designed to be accessible, fast, and easy to extend.

Some key features include:
- **Full Site Editing**: Complete control over templates and global styles.
- **Customizable Block Patterns**: Pre-designed sections for headers, footers, galleries, and more.
- **Clean and Minimalist Design**: Focuses on performance and aesthetics.
- **Accessibility Ready**: Built with best practices to ensure usability for everyone.
